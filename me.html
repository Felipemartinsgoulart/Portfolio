							Hello! My name is Felipe Goulart, I'm 26 years old and I'm a web and mobile developer. My specialty is business management systems.
							I was born in São Luís, Maranhão, and I lived there for 14 years. Then, I moved to Brasilia. I started coding when a was 13 with the help of an older cousin. When I started, I used only books and a computer without internet. After 2 years, I hadn't coded a single line. One day, a friend's dad said he was in trouble at his company so I said I could help with a simple program, and I did it (yes I made some money).I thought that could be cool. I liked the feeling that I could create something, and this made me want to learn more about other programing languages and, afterwards, other things like cooking, photography, politics, math, design and physics. I think coding is a great tool that changes lives. Coding is for everyone at any age and any social class. It's the skill of the future. Every day more people share new discoveries and being part of this network is very cool. Programming also helps to develop problem-solving skills and stimulate creativity.
							I worked at the Museu de Ciência e Tecnologia de Brasília and developed the museum's website and some tools for the museum's events. I also worked at Agência Espacial de Brasília (AEB), where I developed the current website that they use to share the works of the agency and partners. In addition to that, I created other internal applications and worked in the educational and communication area. After that, I worked in the government, at the Controladoria Do Distrito Federal to be more precise. I created tools for several internal projects. One of them was a program developed in 100 schools of Distrito Federal, where we audited the schools using an app with the help of the students. Today, the system that was developed in this program is used in more than 6 states.I currently work for a private company called MSF and I develop a management system for hemodialysis clinics.
							For the past month, I've been involved in a social project called "A Menina que Calculava". This project was made by girls who are students at UnB and it aims at helping other girls with Math and Physics. I created a system that helps manage all the teachers and students. I studied Computer Science UnB but nowadays I study Physics there.
