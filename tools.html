					<p>This is a really big question, I could spend days talking about the tools I use to code but I will try to choose by category. To create an application or a website we first need to draw a fully functional flowchart and which paths users will take in the app, for this step I usually use pencil and a small notebook, When main features are clear it's time to go to the computer, for that part I use <a href="https://www.mockflow.com/">Mockflow</a> .There are many similar sites and apps to do the same thing, you can try them all and choose the one you like best. Next, I study which language is right for my project, considering which platform I am going to launch (computers, mobile phones, internet and others options). After choosing the language I need to choose a code editor, usually I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> , but for some languages ​​there are better editors, but it's also a very personal choice, you can even program in notepad (there are people who do that, <code>really!</code>). When your project starts to grow big and you need to keep track of your code versions, you can eventually change your mind about something you have done, or think of a better way to write some of your code and at this point it's interesting to see all updates your code has received and back to the point where you want to improve. To fix bugs, this functionality is also very useful. Imagine you work and update your code 20 times and then you will test and there's a bug. How do you know which of the 20 updates are have a bug? For this I use <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (<code><a href="https://github.com/Felipemartinsgoulart">follow me there guys!</a></code>). These tools are the ones I use all the time and are the most useful, there are many other tools with very specific functions, they are over 20, and they depend on the project. The main tool is the code editor. It is much harder to program something bigger than 50 lines without it, from there you choose the tools according to your taste and your project.</p>
